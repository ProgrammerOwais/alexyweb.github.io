 ## Redirect funcion 

 The main & basic thing about this project is that  I used redirect function.
 This function is used in those cases where you have a web in which 
 there is a lot of coding or the web layout/functionality is totally
 different for mobile , tablet & desktop & in this scenario you can't
 put all different data in one html/css/JavaScript files. The purpose 
 of the function is that when you opening it in mobile device it will 
 open mobile.html file or when you open the same web in tablet devices 
 it will lead you to tablet.html file & so on.
